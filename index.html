				<p class="post">Here are some little things about me. I am a full-time underwriting assistant and mother to my beautiful two-year-old daughter. I have been living in Arizona for many years, since June 2005 to be exact. It was <strong>so hot</strong> when we moved out to Arizona, just like how the weather is now. Not fun....

				<p class="post">I graduated high school in Laveen with a high school diploma in 2013 but also took many college classes while in high school. I continued college after high school to pursue an Associates Degree in General Business, which I am <em>still</em> in college. Luckily, I only have one more class to finish which is a science class. I ask myself everyday why did I chose to procastinate to finish this subject because who likes science right? As most may know already, I am currently teaching myself web devlopment so I can start helping small business with having functional and beautiful websites to help keep visitors to come back to visit their sites. <strong>Best decision ever!</strong>

					"Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life--think of it, dream of it, live on that idea. Let the brain, muscles, nerves, every part of your body, be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone. This is the way to success." -Swami Vivekananda
